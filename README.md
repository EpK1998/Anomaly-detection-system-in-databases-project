Project Purpose â€“ Detect the optimal algorithm and predict the target variable 'FLOWCOOLPRESSURE'

Summary - To achieve this, we applied various machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, dataset testing and prediction, to identify patterns and relationships within the dataset. 

note: all data are too big to uploud here but it's all in our computer.

thank you!
